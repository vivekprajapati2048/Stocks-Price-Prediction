# Stocks-Price-Prediction
Prediction of stocks price using different Linear Regression and SVR using the dataset imported from Quandl.

Our goal here is to take the continious data, find the equation that best fits the data and be able to forecast out the specific value. We are considering the fluidity of price over time, and attempting to forecast the next fluid price in the future using continious dataset. We are using the website Quandl for the dataset.
